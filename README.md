### Description

Finally the much-awaited (i wish :-P) sequel to PaddleMax, the extremely popular (i wish) game that stormed (i wish) the net!

No, seriously, its a VB spinoff of those classing "destroy the bricks with the bouncing ball" games, with some cool powerups that give it a unique edge. I just took all the feedback given on the 1st one and made a second one with all new levels!

It comes with a level editor, and is COMPLETELY commented. Please vote and leave comments!
